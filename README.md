-Users would simply click and type the name of the character in the input section located on the top right of the screen.

-Then Users can add that character by clicking the "Add a hero!" button located directly underneath the input section.

-A new button will then be created on the top left of the webpage, with the name of the character that the user wishes to add.

-When users click on a button with the character's name, the UI will display GIFs related to that character.

-By clicking on the GIF users are able to pause/resume the GIF.
